    title: About
    content: >
      I fell in love with the analytics space through building data pipelines
      for operations research models in Industrial Engineering domains. I was
      always fascinated by the quantitative nature within the systems around us.


      My experience in the tech industry has been in both technical and program
      management roles and I excel at reconciling the two through an systems
      perspective. Take a look at the projects section below to see data coming
      together from different domains into analytical data models!


      For fun, I enjoy traveling and building sensors. Currently, I'm traveling
      in a converted Ford 250 house-van built for remote work with the intention
      of settling in Seattle.
