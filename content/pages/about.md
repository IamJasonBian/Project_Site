### ***Industrial Engineer at Heart***

I am an industrial engineer at heart. To follow my interest in the trades and manufacturing, I built a house-van with the latest technologies equipped with electric, water, sewage and cloud sensoring systems. With my project management skills, I made sure that I have adequate buffers in food, electric, and water and that the shortest paths along the van are optimized for my trip.

### ***Transitioning Data Engineer***

Coming from operations planning in my factory days, I modeled the van as single production plant via cloud sensoring through the custom inverter system. Data stored in azure blobs serve statistics that show exact solar production for route planning. Daily food trips, systems maintenance, and vehicle maintenance is schedule via tight factory production schedules. All this is done through the collection of data.

I'm fluent in the modern web stack and big data stacks as well as cloud solutions architecture (AWS and Azure) and appreciate clean, well-documented code that solves problems. Outside of full-stack architecture and development, I use Python and SQL for data engineering projects, R and SQL for data science tasks, Python, C++ and R for optimization and Django for front-end visualization/development.

### &#xA;***Continuous Learner***

To continue on my journey in the world of analytics and operations, I am looking to settle in Seattle and transition into a data engineer. I learn by doing and strives to learn new things. In that mindset, I dedicate a portion of his time in learning through experimentation, structured online and off-line classes, and the creation of MVP prototypes.
