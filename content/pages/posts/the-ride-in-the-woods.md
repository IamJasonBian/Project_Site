excerpt: >-
  With soaring real-estate prices, friends in different cities, and the promise
  of a minimalistic life free of modern trappings, I have been building a
  van-house within my Ford Transit 250 high roof. To enable a sustainable career
  in the van, I need to ensure good technological capacity to grow and compete
  globally.
